This repos shows the way upto making a neual network model from starting and leading upto a definable accuracy and also things that we can do with neural networks.
NOTE:-Every update on the basis of adding code or optimizing certain code are representated datewise below. Further update will be added on the working basis.

Cat vs Dog classification using neural network with 50% training accuracy and 48% test accuracy which is not a great result. This code show how you can use neural network to do this binary classification. It uses simple workable code of Logistic Regression.
